# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I used QuickDBD to create my entity relationship diagram. I found this very useful for visualizing realtionships while writing queries. I used SQL on pgAdmin to analyze the employees from the database from the fictional company.  

I used this website to learn how to better work with the DATE datatype and find the correct employees hired in 1986.

I used this website to figure out how to find the last name that starts with B. I knew I had to use B% but I was unclear as to how I did that. https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_like.asp#:~:text=The%20LIKE%20command%20is%20used,a%20question%20mark%20(%3F)%20instead)

I figured out ow to use JOIN better using this website. I used the code under the "How SQL multiple joins work?" as a template for my own join coding.
