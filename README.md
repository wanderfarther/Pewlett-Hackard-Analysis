# "Pewlett Hackard" Employee Analysis
I was tasked by "Pewlett Hackard" to create and analyse a database of employees between 1980 and 2000. In this research project, I modeled the data in an entity relationship diagram, engineered the data by creating a database in pgAdmin using SQL language, and then analyzed the data. 

## Data Modeling
I used QuickDBD (https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) to create an ERD. This allowed me to visualize the primary keys, the foreign keys, and other relationships, which aided me in creating the different table schemas in the database in pgAdmin. I also found this very useful for visualizing realtionships while writing queries.

## Data Engineering
I used SQL in pgAdmin to create a database of the employees using 6 CVS files. After reviewing the ERD, I used the following table schema to create the tables in the pgAdmin database. This required assigning the correct data type to each data column and creating the correct connections through primary and foreign key assignments.

## Data Analysis
I used SQL to analyze the data in the pgAdmin database I created. I querried for the following data:

Employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary
